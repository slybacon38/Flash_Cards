        "answer": "A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. The proxy server evaluates the requests and determines if they should be forwarded."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different types of proxy servers?...",
        "answer": "There are two main types of proxy servers:\nForward proxy: A proxy that sits between client computers and the internet. It is used by clients on a network to access external resources.\nReverse proxy: A proxy that sits in front of web servers, intercepting requests from clients. It is used to protect and optimize the web servers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a reverse proxy?",
        "answer": "A reverse proxy server sits in front of web servers, intercepting requests from clients. It then forwards those requests to the appropriate backend server. Reverse proxies can provide security, load balancing, and performance enhancements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a load balancer?",
        "answer": "A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a load balancer improve security?",
        "answer": "Load balancers can improve security by:\nDistributing traffic, making it harder to overwhelm a single server (mitigating DDoS attacks).\nHiding the identity and characteristics of backend servers.\nProviding SSL termination, reducing the load on backend servers."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a network tap?",
        "answer": "A network tap (test access point) is a hardware device that allows you to capture network traffic without interrupting the flow of data. It creates a copy of the network traffic, which can then be analyzed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a packet analyzer?",
        "answer": "A packet analyzer is a software tool that captures and analyzes network traffic. It allows you to examine the contents of individual packets and understand network communication in detail."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a network sniffer?",
        "answer": "A network sniffer is a tool (hardware or software) that can intercept and log network traffic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a protocol analyzer?",
        "answer": "A protocol analyzer is a tool that captures and analyzes network traffic at the protocol level, providing insights into the structure and content of network packets."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a wireless sniffer?",
        "answer": "A wireless sniffer is a tool that captures wireless network traffic."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a captive portal?",
        "answer": "A captive portal is a web page that users are required to view and interact with before they can access a network, often a public Wi-Fi network."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are captive portals used for security?",
        "answer": "Captive portals are used for security to:\nAuthenticate users before granting network access.\nRequire users to agree to terms of service or acceptable use policies.\nCollect user information."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a virtual LAN (VLAN)?",
        "answer": "A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical grouping of network devices that allows them to communicate as if they were on the same physical LAN, regardless of their actual physical location."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do VLANs improve network security?",
        "answer": "VLANs improve network security by:\nSegmenting the network: Isolating traffic between different groups of users or devices.\nReducing broadcast domains: Limiting the spread of broadcast traffic.\nEnforcing access control: Making it easier to implement access control policies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is network segmentation?",
        "answer": "Network segmentation is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more isolated parts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is network segmentation important for security?",
        "answer": "Network segmentation is important for security because:\nIt limits the spread of attacks: If one segment is compromised, the attacker's access to other segments is restricted.\nIt improves security monitoring: It is easier to monitor traffic within smaller, more defined segments.\nIt enhances compliance: It can help organizations comply with regulations that require data isolation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a demilitarized zone (DMZ)?",
        "answer": "A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a physical or logical subnet that separates a local area network (LAN) from other untrusted networks, usually the internet. It hosts services that need to be accessible from the outside world, such as web servers and email servers, while protecting the internal network."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a VPN?",
        "answer": "A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to access a private network remotely or to browse the internet securely and anonymously."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different VPN protocols?...",
        "answer": "Different VPN protocols include:\nIPsec (Internet Protocol Security)\nSSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)\nWireGuard\nOpenVPN\nPPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) - now considered insecure"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is IPsec?",
        "answer": "Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is SSL/TLS VPN?",
        "answer": "An SSL/TLS VPN is a type of VPN that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols for encryption. Often used for web browser access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a firewall?",
        "answer": "A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different types of firewalls?",
        "answer": "Packet filtering firewall\nStateful inspection firewall\nProxy firewall\nNext-generation firewall (NGFW)"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are firewall rules?",
        "answer": "Firewall rules are sets of instructions that define which network traffic is allowed or blocked by the firewall. These rules are based on various criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and application."
